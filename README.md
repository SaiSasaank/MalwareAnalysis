# MalwareAnalysis\

Introduction to static and dynamic malware analysis. Basic and advanced tools are presented, both host- and web-based. Utilities to provide summary information, as well as disassemblers and debuggers, are discussed in detail. Emphasis is on analysis of realistic malware specimens from the texttbook, or found in the wild. Homeworks and exams consist of preparation of malware analysis reports isuch as those used in industry.

Objectives:
We explore both static and dynamic malware analysis. Although malware takes many forms, we focus on executable binaries. We will cover object file formats, and the use of tools such as debuggers, virtual machines, and disassemblers. Obfuscation and packing schemes will be discussed, along with various issues related to Windows internals.

Students will acquire knowledge of relevant system internals, and experience in using various malware analysis tools. Students will also acquire insight into emerging tends in malware design, including efforts to deter analysis.
